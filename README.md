# Cy O2Reader
An Nano based O2 analyzer for Nitrogen Diver and gas blender.
This is an open sourced project that based on Arduino Nano MCU.
Idea of this project is to reuse Expired JJ-CCR O2 sensor.
Project highlights:
  1. Re Ues JJCCR O2 sensor.
  2. Auto calculate MODs for diver who is not good at math:)
  3. PCB and Hardware spec will be provided.
  4. Display sensor current value so you can estimate sensor battery life. this gives you a chance to check the sensor without CCR controllor. 
  5. Ues ADS1115 as ADC, it provides high resoultion for batter conversation results
  
Enjoy!
